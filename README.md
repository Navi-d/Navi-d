- 👋 Hi everyone, I’m Navid and I am 19 years old!
- 👀 The one thing That I really enjoy about coding is fixing errors. It sometimes goes to a point that you are like this would never work, but after several days of researching
and getting peoples help, there is always a way. The feeling you get when fixing an error is amazing haha.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I am still super new to this but i made game using pygame and before that i made a game which was ran on the terminal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to improve my coding skills everyday and at the same time help people as much as I can.
