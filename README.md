- 👋 Hi everyone, I’m Navid and I am 19 years old!
- 👀 The one thing That I really enjoy about coding is fixing errors. It sometimes gets to a point that you are like this would never work, but after hours and days of researching, there is always a way. The feeling you get when fixing an error is amazing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. Pygame is one of my favorite libraries that you can use to create games and be creative!
- 💞️ I’m looking to improve my coding skills everyday and at the same time help people as much as I can.
